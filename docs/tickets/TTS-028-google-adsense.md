### TASK: Integrate Google AdSense

**Description**:  
Implement Google AdSense integration to enable monetization of the Text Tools Suite application. This includes creating ad placement components, configuring ad units, and ensuring a balanced user experience that doesn't detract from the application's functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:  
- Google AdSense script properly integrated
- Ad placement components created for strategic locations
- Responsive ad units that adapt to different screen sizes
- Non-intrusive ad placement that preserves user experience
- Ad-free option in the UI (for potential future premium tier)
- Performance optimization to minimize impact on page load
- Proper ad loading states and fallbacks
- Analytics for ad performance (impressions, clicks)
- Compliance with AdSense policies and guidelines
- Documentation of ad strategy and placement

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Create a configuration system for ad units and placements
- Implement lazy loading for ads to improve performance
- Use the previously created ad space components
- Consider implementing an ad blocker detection system
- Test ad rendering across different devices and browsers
- Ensure ads don't interfere with tool functionality
- Add appropriate loading states for ad content
- Document the ad implementation for future maintenance
- Consider A/B testing different ad placements
- Implement proper error handling for ad loading failures
