### TASK: Configure Vercel Deployment

**Description**:  
Set up the project for deployment on Vercel, including configuration for continuous deployment from GitHub. This will establish our deployment pipeline and ensure that the application can be easily deployed to production.

**Acceptance Criteria**:  
- Vercel project created and linked to GitHub repository
- Build settings properly configured for TanStack Start
- Environment variables set up (if needed)
- Automatic deployments configured for main branch
- Preview deployments enabled for pull requests
- Custom domain configured (if available)
- First successful deployment completed
- Build performance optimized

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Use Vercel's GitHub integration for automatic setup
- Configure build command as specified in package.json
- Set output directory to match TanStack Start's build output
- Add necessary environment variables for production
- Configure custom domain settings if a domain is available
- Set up branch deployment rules
- Test the deployment process with a simple change

**Files Involved**:
- `vercel.json` (if custom configuration is needed)
- `.vercelignore` (to exclude unnecessary files)
- `package.json` (build scripts)
- `.env.example` (template for environment variables)
- `.github/workflows/` (if additional CI actions are needed)
