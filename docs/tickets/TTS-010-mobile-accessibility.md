### TASK: Add Mobile Responsiveness and Accessibility Features

**Description**:  
Enhance the application with comprehensive mobile responsiveness and accessibility features to ensure the application works well across all devices and is usable by people with disabilities. This includes implementing responsive design patterns, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and other accessibility best practices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:  
- Application is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- All interactive elements are properly sized for touch targets
- Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Proper ARIA attributes implemented throughout the application
- Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes
- Focus management implemented for modals and dialogs
- Skip links added for keyboard users
- Responsive testing documented across multiple devices

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities consistently
- Test with actual mobile devices, not just browser emulation
- Implement focus traps for modal dialogs using FocusTrap or similar
- Use axe-core or similar tools to audit accessibility
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, etc.)
- Add custom focus styles that work for both mouse and keyboard
- Consider implementing reduced motion preferences
- Document accessibility features in the codebase

**Files Involved**:
- `src/components/ui/SkipLink.tsx`
- `src/lib/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts`
- `src/components/ui/FocusTrap.tsx`
- `src/styles/globals.css` (for accessibility-related styles)
- `src/lib/utils/a11y.ts` (accessibility utilities)
- Various component files for ARIA attribute updates
