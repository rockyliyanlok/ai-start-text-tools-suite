### TASK: Conduct Contrast and Accessibility Testing

**Description**:  
Perform comprehensive accessibility testing across the application to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This includes contrast testing, screen reader compatibility, and addressing any accessibility issues identified during testing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Zoom/magnification testing up to 200%
- Reduced motion support for animations
- All ARIA attributes properly implemented
- Alt text for all images and icons
- Accessibility issues documented and resolved
- Accessibility statement added to the application

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Use tools like axe-core or Lighthouse for automated testing
