### TASK: Implement Keyboard Navigation

**Description**:  
Enhance the application with comprehensive keyboard navigation support to ensure accessibility for all users, particularly those who rely on keyboard-only interaction. This includes implementing focus management, keyboard shortcuts, and proper tabbing order.

**Acceptance Criteria**:  
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order throughout the application
- Visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Skip links for bypassing repetitive navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Focus trapping for modal dialogs and popovers
- Focus restoration when dialogs close
- Keyboard navigation documentation for users
- ARIA roles and attributes for screen reader compatibility
- Testing with keyboard-only navigation

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Use native HTML elements where possible for built-in keyboard support
- Implement custom focus management for complex components
- Create a keyboard shortcuts system with documentation
- Add visible focus styles that meet WCAG contrast requirements
- Test tab order and fix any issues with tabindex
- Implement focus traps for modal dialogs using FocusTrap or similar
- Add skip links at the beginning of the page
- Document keyboard shortcuts in the UI and help documentation
- Test with various keyboard layouts and screen readers
- Consider implementing a keyboard shortcuts modal/help panel
