### TASK: Setup Development Tools (Prettier, ESLint, Husky, CI/CD)

**Description**:  
Configure essential development tools including code formatting (Prettier), linting (ESLint), Git hooks (Husky), and CI/CD workflows to ensure code quality and consistent development practices across the team.

**Acceptance Criteria**:  
- ESLint configured with appropriate rules for React and TypeScript
- Prettier configured for consistent code formatting
- Husky set up with pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
- CI/CD workflow configured in GitHub Actions
- Lint and format commands added to package.json
- Documentation on development workflow added to README
- All tools working correctly in development environment
- CI pipeline successfully running on pull requests

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Install ESLint with React and TypeScript plugins
- Configure Prettier with project-specific formatting rules
- Set up Husky to run linting and formatting on pre-commit
- Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Add lint-staged to only process changed files
- Configure VSCode settings for editor integration
- Test the complete workflow to ensure it works as expected
